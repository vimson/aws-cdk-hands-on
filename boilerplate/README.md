This is a boilerplate for Lambda + Api gateway stack, which we can use as a started for our REST API projects

The `cdk.json` file tells the CDK Toolkit how to execute your app.

- `npm run test` perform the jest unit tests
- `cdk deploy` deploy this stack to your default AWS account/region
- `cdk diff` compare deployed stack with current state
